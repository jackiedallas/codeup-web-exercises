## Problems

You **should not modify** the HTML attributes or structure, but you can include jQuery in the project to help you solve the problems below. A video documenting the expected output of each problem can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkm4d9Ln-Mo).

1. When the box with the id of `dbl-click-box` is double-clicked, an alert should pop up with the text 'BOX DOUBLE-CLICKED!'
    
2. Clicking on the button with an id of `dark-mode-btn` toggles dark mode on and off. *HINT: changes should be applied to the body of the HTML.* 

3. When the cursor hovers over the span with the id of uppercase (`<span id="uppercase">`), take the text of that span and display it, in lowercase, in the span with the id of lowercase (`<span id="lowercase">`).

4. The span with an id of `counter` should increment by one every second.

5. When the user clicks on the button (`<button id="list-chars-btn">`), take any text the user has typed in the input field (`<input id="characters">`), and output each individual character as a separate list item within the unordered list (`<ul id="characters-list">`). 
   Clicking the button multiple times should not append additional list items.

6. When the user clicks on the button (`<button id="clean-animal-list-btn">`), the text of each list item that has a class (`<li class="animal-list-item">`) should be concatenated to the list item that immediately follows it.

7. When hovering over the divs within the div with a class of `hidden-letters`, a letter will become visible in a span within the div being hovered over.

## Grading

Each problem is worth 1 point. A point will be awarded if your output matches the output in the demo video.
